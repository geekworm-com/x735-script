## Usage

This Bash script offers seamless control over your Raspberry Pi's fan speed and power management, ensuring optimal performance while maintaining efficient temperature regulation. With the added convenience of safe shutdown capabilities, you can confidently power down your system using the command:

``` bash
sudo x735off
```

To monitor the fan speed and its operational status, simply query the `x735-fan.service` service using the following command:

``` bash
systemctl status x735-fan.service
```

Should you wish to take manual control of the fan, you have the flexibility to halt or restart it using the respective commands:

``` bash
sudo systemctl stop x735-fan.service
sudo systemctl start x735-fan.service
```

This script empowers you to fine-tune your Raspberry Pi's performance by automatically adjusting fan speed as needed, ensuring a cool and optimized computing experience. The seamless integration of power management and temperature control provides a comprehensive solution for Raspberry Pi enthusiasts seeking both reliability and performance.
